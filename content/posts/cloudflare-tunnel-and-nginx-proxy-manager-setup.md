## The Problem
Exposing some of my homelab services to the internet involves forwarding ports on my router (specifically 80 and 443) to the machines hosting them.  This is bad and makes me paranoid.  I wanted to be able to reach these services from outside without compromising my networks security.

## The Solution
Set up a **Cloudflare Tunnel** and **NGINX Proxy Manager**

### Cloudflare's Tunnel
According to Cloudflare themselves, a **Cloudflare Tunnel**...

>  *...exposes applications running on your local web server on any network with an internet connection without manually adding DNS records or configuring a firewall or router.*

You can read more about *Cloudflare's Tunnels* on [their website](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/tunnel/).  You can create a [free Cloudflare account](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/) that allows you to create a Tunnel for no extra charge.

You will need to setup a domain on cloudflares DNS service for the Tunnel to work, but the domain itself doesn't need to be registered with Cloudflare.  I used one I bought from [Ionas for Â£1.00](https://www.ionos.co.uk/domains/domain-names), but it works just as well with free domains.  You just need to delgate Cloudflare as the authoritative DNS nameserver by replacing your domains original nameservers with ones provided by Cloudflare.

### NGINX Proxy Manager
The other component of this solution is a reverse proxy server, specifically in this case NGINX Proxy Manager.  **A reverse proxy server**...

> *...typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.*

You can find more about *NGIX Proxy Manger* on [their website](https://nginxproxymanager.com/).  It is a free. open source solution. I setup NGIX in a docker container using Docker Compose, but that is probably worthy of a post of it own.

## Setting Up the cloudflare Tunnel
Cloudflare Tunnel requires the installation and configuration of a lightweight, open-source server-side daemon, *cloudflared*, to connect your infrastructure to Cloudflare.  Releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) and downloads are available as standalone binaries or packages like Debian and RPM.

### 1. Install the Cloudflared package

Download and setup Cloudflared using...

```lang-bash
$ wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb
$ sudo dkpg -i cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb
```
This creates a default directory when storing credentials files for your tunnel and the certificates it generates when you authenticate with Cloudflare.  The default directory is also where cloudflared will look for a configuration file (assuming no other file path is specified when running a tunnel).

This directory will be in the home directory `~/.cloudflared`.


### 2. Authenticate with Your Cloudflare Account
Cloudflared needs to be authenticated with a valid Cloudflare account using...

```lang-bash
$ cloudflared tunnel login
```
Open the URL that this generates and log into your Cloudflared account.  If successful the webpage will tell you everything is authenticated and will issue you a certificate by putting the file `cert.pem` in the `~/.cloudflared` directory.

### 3. Create a New Tunnel
With the Cloudflared successfully authenticate, you can create a tunnel...

```lang-bash
$ cloudflared tunnel create <TUNNEL-NAME>
```
- `<TUNNEL-NAME>` is want to call the new Tunnel.

This sets up a new Tunnel and creates a [Credentials file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#credentials-file) in the `~/.cloudflared` directory.

### 4. Confirm the Tunnel is Running
All being well, a new Tunnel has been created.  This can be confirmed with the command...

```lang-bash
$ cloudflared tunnel list
```

If the Tunnel is running you should get an output along the lines of...

```lang-bash
You can obtain more detailed information for each tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel info <name/uuid>`
ID                                      NAME            CREATED                 CONNECTIONS
c522d8e5f-3b55-4abcd-8416-0335c87a1457  <TUNNEL-NAME>   2022-05-03T20:31:57Z    2xAMS, 2xLHR
```
Note the `ID` in the reponse.  This the [Tunnel UUID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#tunnel-uuid).  You will need this in the next step.

### 5. Create a config.yaml File
Cloudflared is going to need some configuration to tell it how the Tunnel should function.  This is done using a `.yaml` file.  Cloudflared will automatically look for the configuration file in the default `~/.cloudflared` directory.  Create the file using...

```lang-bash
$ nano ~/test/config.yaml
```
The `config.yaml` file should contain...
```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL-UUID>
credentials-file: /home/username/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-UUID>.json
originRequest:
  originServerName: <DOMAIN>
ingress:
  - hostname: <DOMAIN>
  service: https://localhost:443
  originRequest:
    noTLSVerify: true
  - service: http_status:404
```

- `<TUNNEL-UUID>` is the [Tunnel UUID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#tunnel-uuid) you got from the step above.
- `<DOMAIN>` is the domain name you have setup in your Cloudflare DNS service.
