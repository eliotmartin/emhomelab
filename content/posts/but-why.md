Inspired by the [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) and [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) subreddits I have recently created a small home lab environment and been leveraging percussive maintenance (or *hitting it until it works*) to set up various open source projects, with the aim of maybe learning something en route.

I'm going to use this blog (mainly) as an incentive to capture the detail of some of these projects to ensure I have reference documentation when something inevitably explodes, but also because it might even help someone else out.

Off we go...
